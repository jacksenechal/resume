"Jack is **an exceptional engineer and leader**. He strives to **deeply understand the technology**
he's working on while remaining cognizant of the socio-technical components that may be a factor in
any project. He's thorough, detail-oriented, and outcome-oriented, which means **the solutions he
architects, builds, and collaborates on come out better**. Jack also strives to be at the forefront of
new technology and assess how he can leverage it. Newer tech like GenAI can be complex and
ever-evolving, and Jack is not one to back down but step up and embrace. He does all this with a
**strong team mentality**, is a phenomenal team player, and can **effectively delegate to help lift
others' skill sets**."
