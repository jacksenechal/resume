<ul>
<li>Operations Team Leadership: Over four years, I recruited and led a
new team dedicated to building and scaling the infrastructure platform.
I was instrumental in leading the transition towards a DevOps culture
throughout the organization. I created a clear, calm, and constructive
environment that allowed the team to thrive. I was responsible for
roadmap stewardship, untangling requirements, and arranging priorities
to maximize flow. We transitioned a large legacy infrastructure codebase
to cutting edge, cloud-native, IAC-oriented tools. I was also involved
in coding, architecture, and collaboration on numerous mission-critical
projects.</li>
<li>Insights Platform Leadership: For three months, I led a short
transition team that was responsible for overseeing and improving the BI
data pipeline. We successfully migrated the pipeline to Kubernetes.</li>
<li>M-Bridge Platform Leadership: For two years, I spearheaded a new
team to stabilize and enhance an agent-based integration platform. We
established operational metrics that significantly reduced errors and
incidents by approximately 100x. We successfully performed a migration
to Kubernetes with zero downtime, including relational, document, and
cache databases.</li>
<li>Additional Responsibilities: I took on cross-functional roles that
included mentorship and coaching, interviewing and hiring, and
organizational change management and process optimization. My efforts
were recognized when I received the Top Performer Award in 2021.</li>

<p>“Jack is <strong>an exceptional engineer and leader</strong>. He
strives to <strong>deeply understand the technology</strong> he’s
working on while remaining cognizant of the socio-technical components
that may be a factor in any project. He’s thorough, detail-oriented, and
outcome-oriented, which means <strong>the solutions he architects,
builds, and collaborates on come out better</strong>. Jack also strives
to be at the forefront of new technology and assess how he can leverage
it. Newer tech like GenAI can be complex and ever-evolving, and Jack is
not one to back down but step up and embrace. He does all this with a
<strong>strong team mentality</strong>, is a phenomenal team player, and
can <strong>effectively delegate to help lift others’ skill
sets</strong>.”</p>

guided me and my team through a bunch of challenging gitops situations
with patience and kindness, leading by example. Always diligent with his
work, willing to roll up his sleeves to get things done and <strong>find
creative solutions</strong>, maybe tinkering in some kind of script that
would make the manual processes easier and more resilient. Everyone
would be lucky to have someone like him in their teams!”</p>
